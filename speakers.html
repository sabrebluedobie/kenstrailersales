			  <h5>Owner</h5>

			  <p>Devin Harvey has shown the following 5 qualities that you would find in a good leader: empathy, confidence, creativity, accountability, and transparency. If you want someone that will show you he can be there on time, every time and do the job right, that is Devin. He instills confidence in the people around him that he will take them in the right direction. Devin also shows he is accountable by accepting responsibility for his work, especially if he has made any mistake. </p>

			  <h5>Office Manager</h5>
  
			  <p>A great office manager is not just someone who provides all of the amenities for our employees, she emphasizes the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done. However, a bad manager can be  what stifles a workforce.</p>
  
			  <p>In Eugenia&#8217;s office, she has shown skills with budgeting, computer programs, data entry, decision-making, conflict resolution, multi-tasking, as well as being detail-oriented. She has modeled how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* the big picture. She can share what those teams, departments, and companies do that others don&#8217;t. Once you&#8217;ve worked within a culture of good management, it&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>
  
			  <h5>About Eugenia</h5>
  
			  <p>Eugenia Bettis is the office manager for Ken&#8217;s Trailers, a dog lover, a foodie, and a kayaking master. You can find her at Ken's, if she isn't spending time with her two Rottweilers, Boss and Daisy.</p>
